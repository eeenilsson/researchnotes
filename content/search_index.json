Tabell 2.1: PICO Letter Explanation Example P Patient, Population, or Problem How would I describe a group of patients similar to mine? I Intervention, Prognostic Factor, or Exposure Which main intervention, prognostic factor, or exposure am I considering? C Comparison or Intervention (if appropriate) What is the main alternative to compare with the intervention? O Outcome you would like to measure or achieve What can I hope to accomplish, measure, improve, or affect? All relevant papers that try to answer the same or a similar research question should be listed in a table, and the main features (N, study type, grop included/excluded, main measures of outcome, etc) noted systematically in the table. The information in the table will be helpful when writing the background and discussion sections of the paper. 2.2 Content of a scientific paper There are templates for what should be reported in the paper, depending on what type of study has been conducted. Some journals require a filled checklist conforming to specific a reporting guideline. The CONSORT statement details reporting on randomized controlled trials and STROBE is a similar guideline for reporting on observational studies (see section 2.5.2). Its a good idea to go through the CONORT or STROBE checklist and write answers to each item before starting to write the paper (it should also have been considered in the planning phase of the study). This will give you an idea of what results to include. Divide work into sections and subsections with headings. 2.2.1 Introduction A total of three to five paragraphs is recommended. State the problem, starting with a broad overview. Strive to formulate the problem in a hypothesis (yes/no) or question. Focus readers attentions on the aims of your investigation. Motivate this choice of aims. Describe the research approach briefly, eg ‚Äúwe tested this hypothesis using knock-out mice‚Äù. Summarize the conclusion (optional), ‚Äúour findings suggest‚Ä¶‚Äù Three paragraphs may be appropriate. Perhaps: Present with enthusiasm [This may not be appreciated by everyone] (ok to use ‚Äúdramaticallly‚Äù, ‚Äúunexpectedly‚Äù, ‚Äúinterestingly‚Äù) 2.2.2 Material &amp; methods Establish your scientific credibility: Appropriate methods. Allow others to reproduce study. Method: How was the evidence obtained. If anything novel in methodology (small change in procedure?), emphasize this. Se icme.org &amp; consort-statement.org 2.2.2.1 Outline Substances used: Drugs, reagents, antibodies, chemicals) Subjects studied: PAtients, animals, cells Sample collection procedures: Blood, biopsies, cells, proteins, DNA. Analyses: Activity, quantity, localization, structure. Statistical analyses. 2.2.3 Results Present the evidence. Validate the evidence (statistics) Show results that relate to the formal argument, avoid excess/irrelevant information. Show results only once. Values in tables &amp; figures should #not# be repeated in the text. Exception: A very important finding. Describe a figure in more general terms in the text (emphasize result). Beskriv resultaten i ord och h√§nvisa till tabeller och figurer. Peka p√• intressanta resultat, s√§rskilt s√•dana som du sedan belyser i diskussionsdelen. Upprepa dock inte siffror fr√•n tabeller och figurer. Alla tabeller och figurer b√∂r h√§nvisas till fr√•n texten (Table 1). Tabell 2.2: Baseline characteristics Variable Mean SD Age, years 55 8.3 Weight, kg 67 3.4 2.2.3.1 Outline Prepare figures and tables: What data are important to convince the reader of my conclusion. Organize these tables in an appropriate order. 2.2.4 Discussion Discuss implications, Evaluate supportive and conflicting evidence, Draw conclusions. Common problems: Lack of clear line of thoght. Unbalanced treatments of others results. Too much or too little speculation. Boringness. 2.2.4.1 Outline Begin with summmarizing the major novel findings in one paragraph. ‚ÄúThe major, novel findings in the present investigation are the following‚Ä¶‚Äù Discuss possible underlying mechanisms for the observed assocaiations. Comparison against what others have reported. ‚ÄúIn line with what NN reported‚Ä¶‚Äù. If discrepancies, compare methods used, even small details. Or ‚Äúat present, these discrepancies cannot be explained‚Äù. Consider possible limitations and strengths. Risk for bias? Small N? Ambigous protocol? Ioannidis, Journal of clinical epidmiology, 2007. Draw a conclusion - convince! Discuss possible consequences of your observations (in research or clinical practice). Tips: En viss studiedesign √§r f√∂rknippad med vissa typer av problem och begr√§nsningar. Kolla upp vanliga felk√§llor f√∂r den studiedesign du anv√§nder (tex kohortstudie). Ben√§mn dessa och beskriv vad (om n√•got) som gjordes i din studie f√∂r att minimera effekterna av s√•dan bias. Deta g√∂rs vanligen i avsnittet om ‚Äúlimitations‚Äù. Exempelvis finns i observationsstudier ofta ‚Äúconfounding by indication‚Äù, och ‚Äúresidual confounding from measured and unmeasured factors‚Äù. Andra typer av bias som kan ben√§mnas √§r tex ‚Äúselection bias‚Äù och ‚Äúdetection bias‚Äù. Diskutera √§ven extern validitet. Tips: N√§r du j√§mf√∂r med tidigare forskning kan du beskriva skillnader och likheter mellan din egen och annan studie exempelvis avseende datak√§llor (tex register vs journaler), studiepopulationens storlek och sammans√§ttning (skillnader i √•lder, k√∂n, sjukdomar), m√§tmetod f√∂r utfallsvariabler (diagnoser vs laboratorieanlyser), hantering av bortfall och bias, uppf√∂ljningstidens l√§ngd. Du kan spekulera om eventuella olikheter i resultat kan bero p√• dessa skillnader. 2.2.5 Abstract It is recommended that you write the abstract after the rest of the paper is finished. This will save you unnecessary work before it has become clear what is to be included and emphasized. It is common for the abstract to include a summary of the results including some numbers, since many readers only have access to the abstract. Background Kontext. Varf√∂r beh√∂vs denna forskning: Vad vi har, vad vi vill ha. Uppgift/ vad vi gjorde Syftet med detta arbete Methods Studiedesign. Definition av exposure och outcome. Results Hur m√•nga inkluderades? Huvudsakliga resultat inklusive siffror. Conclusion Summering av resultatet i en mening. Perspektiv/potentiell nytta/ klinisk relevans. üîó An effective abstract 2.3 Language 2.3.1 Present and past tense Method: Past tense (describes what you did). Results: Past tense. Eg ‚ÄúNitric oxide caused‚Ä¶‚Äù Anywhere where earlier data is referenced (into, discussion etc) use past tense. Exception: Accepted facts (‚ÄúNO decreases blood pressure‚Ä¶‚Äù) When referring to tables use present tense (‚Äútable 1 shows‚Ä¶‚Äù). 2.3.2 Misc Write simply - get your message across British or American spelling? Check the Instructions for Authors of the journal where you hope to publish your paper. Some journals want you to use British spelling. Others want American spelling. Some even want you to follow the conventions of a specific dictionary. If the journal states a preference, try to do as they suggest. If there is nothing about spelling in the Instructions for Authors, choose whatever system you like ‚Äì but be consistent! If you start a sentence with a number, it must be written in text. This makes large numbers unwieldy, and you should therefore re-phrase the sentence so that it starts with a word instead. Eg: INCORRECT: 2 groups were defined. CORRECT: Two groups were defined. INCORRECT: 1200 persons were included in the study. CORRECT: A total of 1200 persons were included in the study. 2.3.3 Grammar Subject-verb agreement: English requires that the subject and the verb in a sentence agree in number. A singular subject requires a singular verb form. Plural subjects require plural verb forms. Eg people need vs a man needs. Dangling modifiers: I saw a dog #eating at the town dump#. Make sure the modifier is next to the sentence they are supposed to modyfy. Avoid starting a sentence with ‚ÄúUsing‚Äù - risk of unclear dangling modifiers. 2.3.4 Choosing words Right level: Avoid specialist jargon. Try it on a reader outside the group. Any misunderstandings can be marked and you should suppose they are your fault, not the readers. String of nouns: A DRAIN is one thing. A PIPE is something else. A DRAINPIPE is another thing entirely. Dont string together too many =&gt; rewrite/elucuidate. Strive to use concrete, specific words: Extremities =&gt; Arms. Substance =&gt; transmitter =&gt; noradrenaline. Dont actively seek to use Sesquipedalian circumlocutions: The adjective ‚Äúsesquipedalian‚Äù is used to describe a polysyllabic word (like polysyllabic or sesquipedalian itself). Literally, the word means ‚Äúa foot-and-a-half long‚Äù. 2.3.5 Sentences It is easier for YOU to follow along in your line of thought than it is for your readers. Sentence length: If you ask for comments on a draft, and your reader appears confused, check for long sentences. They are easy to spot; all you need to do is count the number of lines they occupy. If you find a long sentence in the confusing section, you can safely assume that it is the sentence‚Äôs fault. Cut it in two or three pieces. One way to make your text lively is to vary your sentence structure. Mix short sentences with long ones. If you have two closely related messages, link them together with a semicolon; such a linked sentence is grammatically correct provided both phrases being linked are complete sentences. Creating compound sentences by using conjunctions such as ‚Äúand‚Äù or ‚Äúbut‚Äù is another way to add variety. Throw in a simple sentence occasionally. Instead of beginning every sentence with an independent clause, put a dependent clause first. 2.3.6 Efficient language Remove filters: When you do research, you carry out an experiment, compile and interpret the results, and draw a conclusion. When you write about that process, it feels perfectly natural to write ‚ÄúWe measured mRNA levels and the results indicate that‚Ä¶‚Äù. But how much does your reader really need to know? For your reader, the important information is the #outcome# of the experiment. It is enough to write ‚ÄúThe mRNA levels indicate that‚Ä¶‚ÄùThe words ‚ÄúWe measured‚Äù and ‚Äúthe results indicate that‚Äù in the long version of the sentence serve no real function. They merely emphasize your own role as experimentator, observer, and interpreter. In other words, they highlight ‚Äúfilters‚Äù along the path between reality and our understanding of reality. When a sentence describes action + effect, see if you can rewrite it to describe only the effect. Direct phrasing: Get to the point. Avoid abstract nouns: it is possible to create abstract nouns from verbs (usually by adding a suffix such as -tion or -ence). These are called nominalizations. Although they are perfectly acceptable grammatically, they force you to use more words. Here‚Äôs an example: create ‚Äì&gt; creation. Unnecessary use of ‚Äúto be‚Äù: Ususally has no function. It is easier to smile than to frown =&gt; Smiling is easier than frowning. Never state the obvious. Active vs passive voice: Differing opinions on this. John caught a fish =&gt; A fish was caught. Editors: Use active voice when possible. Use passive voice when‚Ä¶ 1) it does not matter who or what is doing something (eg materials and methods section), 2) When you dont know (discussion section?), 2.3.6.1 Some more tips remove unnecessary words (e.g., ‚Äúin this study‚Äù) combine phrases and sentences to minimize repetition. One good clue in this connection is that adjacent phrases and sentences containing the same words or expressions can often easily be combined. rephrase in other ways, e.g., by writing more directly (‚Äúincreased‚Äù instead of ‚Äúcaused an increase in‚Äù; ‚Äúto determine whether‚Äù instead of ‚Äúin order to examine the possibility that‚Äù) 2.3.7 Connections Transitions are words that create a logical connection between two ideas. They can be entire phrases, but are often just short, simple words (and, moreover, in addition, but, however, finally, thus, interestingly, nonetheless). Authors often present Fact A and Fact B, and then draw a conclusion without giving any clear indication of how the facts are related. Does Fact B confirm Fact A, or contradict it? Is Fact A a direct cause of Fact B, or completely unrelated? The words you use to connect two thoughts will have a major impact on what information a reader extracts from those thoughts. Clarify your line of thought. How are the conclusions arrived at? Eloquence means expressing a message clearly and persuasively. Also write enjoyable! 2.3.8 Prepositions üîó Purdue online writing lab üîó Guide to grammar 2.3.9 Numbers in text When submitting a paper, check the journal‚Äôs Instructions for Authors to see if they have any specific rules about numbers. Some of the most common rules are: Spell out numbers up to 10 (or 12). Spell out numbers that contain a maximum of two syllables Spell out numbers that can be written as no more than two words. Numbers at the beginning of a sentence should usually be spelled out in full. Years and dates can be written with numerals. However, to minimize the risk of misunderstanding, it is advisable to spell out the month or use a three-letter abbreviation (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc). Numbers followed by units of measurement are written as numerals (15.6 km, 187 kg, 2 ¬µl). Note that if they occur at the beginning of a sentence, both the number and its unit should be spelled out in full. Thus a sentence that begins ‚Äú25 g of salt‚Äù should be written as ‚ÄúTwenty-five grams of salt‚Äù NOT ‚ÄúTwenty-five g of salt‚Äù. Numbers containing decimals or fractions should always be written as numerals. If they occur at the beginning of a sentence, rewrite the sentence! A sentence that begins ‚Äú0.9 g/l saline solution was‚Ä¶‚Äù could be rewritten as ‚ÄúSaline solution (0.9 g/l) was‚Ä¶‚Äù Bend the rules if necessary to prevent confusion. For example, ‚ÄúThe class has 6 18-year-old students‚Äù might be misinterpreted to mean ‚ÄúThe class has 618-year-old students.‚Äù Write ‚Äú6 eighteen-year-old students‚Äù or ‚Äúsix 18-year-old students‚Äù instead. 2.4 Scientific notation 2.4.1 Att skriva stora och sm√• tal F√∂r att p√• ett koncist s√§tt skriva tal som √§r v√§ldigt stora eller v√§ldigt sm√• anv√§nds vetenskaplig notation. Tal skrivs d√• med tipopotenser, exempelvis tv√• miljoner = 2x10^6. 2.4.2 Perspektiv: Powers of Ten POWERS OF TEN ¬© 1977 EAMES OFFICE LLC (Available at www.eamesoffice.com) 2.4.3 Mantissan: Skala respektive precision. Tag f√∂ljande exempel: Talet 125 000 kan med vetanskaplig notation skrivas som 1.25x10^3 d√§r delen 1.25 (mantissan eller signifikanten) motsvarar d√• talets precision, emedan 10¬≥ (exponenten, eller eng ‚Äúpower term‚Äù) beskriver talets skala. Om vi till exempel √§r intresserade av att beskriva avst√•ndet mellan solen och jorden (149 600 000 kilometer) √§r det oftast inte meningsfullt (eller ens m√∂jligt eftersom det varierar) att ange talet med stor precision. Vi kan d√• exempelvis v√§lja att ange str√§ckan med precisionen 150 och skalan x10‚Å∂, dvs 150x10‚Å∂ kilometer. 2.5 Resources 2.5.1 Style guide üîó APA style gives guidance on how details in scientific papers can be presented, for example the formatting of tables.

As the scale of an animal increases the body weight and volume increase with the cube of scale. The volume of blood flow required to feed that bulk also increases with the cube of scale. The cross sectional area of the arteries and the veins required to carry that blood flow only increases with the square of scale. There are other area-volume relationships which impose limitations on creatures. 3.3.5 Notering Genom evolutionen varierar en arts storlek beroende p√• temperatur och andra omgivningsfaktorer. 3.3.6 Evolutionens hastighet Se artikeln om tid 3.3.7 Snabb anpassning Snabb evolution vid h√∂gt selektionstryck.
