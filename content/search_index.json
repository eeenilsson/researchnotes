Usually tables and figures are uploaded to the journal submission site separately from the text (“main body”). It can therefore be a good idea to put tables and figures in separate files. When a first manuscript draft has been made, it is sent to all authors for commenting and editing. To make this work smoothly you need to systematically use version numbering of the files. Make sure to add the version number to all file names. One method is to use the date as the version number. Eg “manuscript_antidepressants_220102.docx”. Make sure to save backup copies of the manuscript, tables and figures in a safe place, for examle dropbox, so that you dont loose work in the event of a computer malfunction. 2.1.1 Comments and editing by other authors Enable “track changes” in the word file before sending it out for comments. When commenting on a version of the manuscript, the one commenting should att their initials to the filename, eg “manuscript_antidepressants_220102_EN.docx”. When all authors have commented, save a new version and accept or reject the suggested changes using the “track changes” tab in word. Remember that you as the main author is responsible for critically reviewing suggested changes so that the manuscript is kept correct. 2.1.2 Authorship Make clear from the beginning the authorship order. The first author is usually expected to do most of the work on the manuscript (drafting, revising after others comments, submitting the manuscript). All authors should fulfil the ICJME criteria for authorship and ideally this should be made clear before the work is started. The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria: Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND Final approval of the version to be published; AND Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. 2.2 Litterature search A systematic search of the litterature covering the subject of the paper should be conducted, for example using the PICO method. Tabell 2.1: PICO Letter Explanation Example P Patient, Population, or Problem How would I describe a group of patients similar to mine? I Intervention, Prognostic Factor, or Exposure Which main intervention, prognostic factor, or exposure am I considering? C Comparison or Intervention (if appropriate) What is the main alternative to compare with the intervention? O Outcome you would like to measure or achieve What can I hope to accomplish, measure, improve, or affect? Scan titles/abstracts to identify potentially relevant papers. Read those, make notes, and add important references used in those papers to your list if not already there. All relevant papers that try to answer the same or a similar research question should be listed in a table (use microsoft excel), and the main features (N, study type, group included/excluded, main measures of outcome, etc) noted systematically in the table. See below for an example. The information in the table will be helpful when writing the background and discussion sections of the paper. Tabell 2.2: Table summarising articles found in litterature search Author Year Population N Exposure definition Outcome definition Estimate Olsson 2019 Major depressive disorder &amp; MADRS &gt;20 279 Escitalopram MADRS &lt;10 HR 1.2 (CI 1.1-1.3) Svensson 2012 Unipolar or bipolar depression 78 Sertraline HDRS17 &lt;7 HR 0.9 (CI 0.7-1.1) Persson 2021 Major depressive disorder &amp; MADRS &gt;20 821 Venlafaxine MADRS 50% reduction HR 1.3 (CI 1.1-1.4) 2.3 Content of a scientific paper There are templates for what should be reported in the paper, depending on what type of study has been conducted. Some journals require a filled checklist conforming to specific a reporting guideline. The CONSORT statement details reporting on randomized controlled trials and STROBE is a similar guideline for reporting on observational studies (see section 2.9.2). Its a good idea to go through the CONORT or STROBE checklist and write answers to each item before starting to write the paper (it should also have been considered in the planning phase of the study). This will give you an idea of what results to include. Divide work into sections and subsections with headings. 2.3.1 Introduction A total of three to five paragraphs is recommended. State the problem, starting with a broad overview. Strive to formulate the problem in a hypothesis (yes/no) or question. Focus readers attentions on the aims of your investigation. Motivate this choice of aims. Describe the research approach briefly, eg “we tested this hypothesis using knock-out mice”. Summarize the conclusion (optional), “our findings suggest…” Can perhaps be tried: Present with enthusiasm [This may not be appreciated by everyone] (ok to use “dramaticallly”, “unexpectedly”, “interestingly”) 2.3.2 Material &amp; methods The method section shows how the evidence was obtained. This section should establish your scientific credibility by showing that appropriate methods were used, and allow others to reproduce study. If anything was novel in the methodology (eg a small change in procedure), emphasize this. 2.3.2.1 Outline of the material &amp; methods section Substances used: Drugs, reagents, antibodies, chemicals. Subjects studied: Patients, animals, cells. Sample collection procedures: Blood, biopsies, cells, proteins, DNA. Analyses: Activity, quantity, localization, structure. Statistical analyses: Methods used, adjustment variables, testing of model assumptions. 2.3.3 Results The purpose of the results section is to present the evidence and to validate it by showing statistics. You should mainly show results that relate to the formal argument you are making and avoid excess/irrelevant information. Show results only once. Values in tables &amp; figures should not be repeated in the text. Exception: A very important finding. Describe a figure in more general terms in the text (emphasize result). Describe the results in words and make references to tables and figures. Point out interesting results, especially those you bring up in the discussion section. You can point out and summarise patterns (eg “comorbid conditions, including diabetes mellitus and heart failure, were more common in the treatment group”), but take care not to interpret or discuss the findings. You should save that for the discussion section. 2.3.3.1 Outline of the results section Prepare figures and tables: What data are important to convince the reader of my conclusion? Organize these tables in an appropriate order. Describe the results in words, referring to tables and figures. 2.3.4 Discussion In the discussion section you should discuss implications, evaluate supportive and conflicting evidence, and draw conclusions. Common problems are lack of clear line of thoght, unbalanced treatments of others results, and too much or too little speculation. Also boringness. 2.3.4.1 Outline of the discussion section Begin with summmarizing the principal findings in one paragraph. “The major, novel findings in the present investigation are the following…” Discuss possible underlying mechanisms for the observed assocaiations. Comparison against what others have reported. “In line with what NN reported…”. If discrepancies, compare methods used, even small details. Or “at present, these discrepancies cannot be explained”. Consider possible limitations and strengths [1]. Risk for bias? Small N? Ambigous protocol? Draw a conclusion - convince! Discuss possible consequences of your observations (in research or clinical practice). Tips: A certain study design is associated with certain types of problems and limitations. Check common sources of error for the study design you are using (eg chort study). Mention these and what (if anything) has been done to minimize the effects of such biases. That is usually done in the paragraph on “limitations”. For example, there is in observational studies often “confounding by indication”, and “residual confounding from measured and unmeasured factors”. Other types of bias that can be menioned is for example “selection bias” and “detection bias”. Also discuss external validity. Tips: When comparing with previous research you can describe differences and similarities between your own and another study concering data sources (eg registers vs patient files), size of the study population and its composition (differences in age, sex, medical disorders), methods for measuring outcomes (eg diagnoses vs laboratory analyses), handling of missing data and bias, length of follow-up. You can speculate on whether differences in these things can explain any discrepancies in results. 2.3.5 Abstract It is recommended that you write the abstract after the rest of the paper is finished. This will save you unnecessary work before it has become clear what is to be included and emphasized. It is common for the abstract to include a summary of the results including some numbers, since many readers only have access to the abstract. Background Kontext. Varför behövs denna forskning: Vad vi har, vad vi vill ha. Uppgift/ vad vi gjorde Syftet med detta arbete Methods Studiedesign. Definition av exposure och outcome. Results Hur många inkluderades? Huvudsakliga resultat inklusive siffror. Conclusion Summering av resultatet i en mening. Perspektiv/potentiell nytta/ klinisk relevans. 🔗 An effective abstract 2.4 Language 2.4.1 Present and past tense Method: Past tense (describes what you did). Results: Past tense. Eg “Nitric oxide caused…” Anywhere where earlier data is referenced (into, discussion etc) use past tense. Exception: Accepted facts (“NO decreases blood pressure…”) When referring to tables use present tense (“table 1 shows…”). 2.4.2 Misc Write simply - get your message across British or American spelling? Check the Instructions for Authors of the journal where you hope to publish your paper. Some journals want you to use British spelling. Others want American spelling. Some even want you to follow the conventions of a specific dictionary. If the journal states a preference, try to do as they suggest. If there is nothing about spelling in the Instructions for Authors, choose whatever system you like – but be consistent! If you start a sentence with a number, it must be written in text. This makes large numbers unwieldy, and you should therefore re-phrase the sentence so that it starts with a word instead. Eg: INCORRECT: 2 groups were defined. CORRECT: Two groups were defined. INCORRECT: 1200 persons were included in the study. CORRECT: A total of 1200 persons were included in the study. 2.4.3 Grammar Subject-verb agreement: English requires that the subject and the verb in a sentence agree in number. A singular subject requires a singular verb form. Plural subjects require plural verb forms. Eg people need vs a man needs. Dangling modifiers: I saw a dog #eating at the town dump#. Make sure the modifier is next to the sentence they are supposed to modyfy. Avoid starting a sentence with “Using” - risk of unclear dangling modifiers. 2.4.4 Choosing words Right level: Avoid specialist jargon. Try it on a reader outside the group. Any misunderstandings can be marked and you should suppose they are your fault, not the readers. String of nouns: A DRAIN is one thing. A PIPE is something else. A DRAINPIPE is another thing entirely. Dont string together too many =&gt; rewrite/elucuidate. Strive to use concrete, specific words: Extremities =&gt; Arms. Substance =&gt; transmitter =&gt; noradrenaline. Dont actively seek to use Sesquipedalian circumlocutions: The adjective “sesquipedalian” is used to describe a polysyllabic word (like polysyllabic or sesquipedalian itself). Literally, the word means “a foot-and-a-half long”. 2.4.5 Sentences It is easier for YOU to follow along in your line of thought than it is for your readers. Sentence length: If you ask for comments on a draft, and your reader appears confused, check for long sentences. They are easy to spot; all you need to do is count the number of lines they occupy. If you find a long sentence in the confusing section, you can safely assume that it is the sentence’s fault. Cut it in two or three pieces. One way to make your text lively is to vary your sentence structure. Mix short sentences with long ones. If you have two closely related messages, link them together with a semicolon; such a linked sentence is grammatically correct provided both phrases being linked are complete sentences. Creating compound sentences by using conjunctions such as “and” or “but” is another way to add variety. Throw in a simple sentence occasionally. Instead of beginning every sentence with an independent clause, put a dependent clause first. 2.4.6 Efficient language Remove filters: When you do research, you carry out an experiment, compile and interpret the results, and draw a conclusion. When you write about that process, it feels perfectly natural to write “We measured mRNA levels and the results indicate that…”. But how much does your reader really need to know? For your reader, the important information is the #outcome# of the experiment. It is enough to write “The mRNA levels indicate that…”The words “We measured” and “the results indicate that” in the long version of the sentence serve no real function. They merely emphasize your own role as experimentator, observer, and interpreter. In other words, they highlight “filters” along the path between reality and our understanding of reality. When a sentence describes action + effect, see if you can rewrite it to describe only the effect. Direct phrasing: Get to the point. Avoid abstract nouns: it is possible to create abstract nouns from verbs (usually by adding a suffix such as -tion or -ence). These are called nominalizations. Although they are perfectly acceptable grammatically, they force you to use more words. Here’s an example: create –&gt; creation. Unnecessary use of “to be”: Ususally has no function. It is easier to smile than to frown =&gt; Smiling is easier than frowning. Never state the obvious. Active vs passive voice: Differing opinions on this. John caught a fish =&gt; A fish was caught. Editors: Use active voice when possible. Use passive voice when… 1) it does not matter who or what is doing something (eg materials and methods section), 2) When you dont know (discussion section?), 2.4.6.1 Some more tips remove unnecessary words (e.g., “in this study”) combine phrases and sentences to minimize repetition. One good clue in this connection is that adjacent phrases and sentences containing the same words or expressions can often easily be combined. rephrase in other ways, e.g., by writing more directly (“increased” instead of “caused an increase in”; “to determine whether” instead of “in order to examine the possibility that”) 2.4.7 Connections Transitions are words that create a logical connection between two ideas. They can be entire phrases, but are often just short, simple words (and, moreover, in addition, but, however, finally, thus, interestingly, nonetheless). Authors often present Fact A and Fact B, and then draw a conclusion without giving any clear indication of how the facts are related. Does Fact B confirm Fact A, or contradict it? Is Fact A a direct cause of Fact B, or completely unrelated? The words you use to connect two thoughts will have a major impact on what information a reader extracts from those thoughts. Clarify your line of thought. How are the conclusions arrived at? Eloquence means expressing a message clearly and persuasively. Also write enjoyable! 2.4.8 Prepositions 🔗 Purdue online writing lab 🔗 Guide to grammar 2.4.9 Numbers in text When submitting a paper, check the journal’s Instructions for Authors to see if they have any specific rules about numbers. Some of the most common rules are: Spell out numbers up to 10 (or 12). Spell out numbers that contain a maximum of two syllables Spell out numbers that can be written as no more than two words. Numbers at the beginning of a sentence should usually be spelled out in full. Years and dates can be written with numerals. However, to minimize the risk of misunderstanding, it is advisable to spell out the month or use a three-letter abbreviation (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc). Numbers followed by units of measurement are written as numerals (15.6 km, 187 kg, 2 µl). Note that if they occur at the beginning of a sentence, both the number and its unit should be spelled out in full. Thus a sentence that begins “25 g of salt” should be written as “Twenty-five grams of salt” NOT “Twenty-five g of salt”. Numbers containing decimals or fractions should always be written as numerals. If they occur at the beginning of a sentence, rewrite the sentence! A sentence that begins “0.9 g/l saline solution was…” could be rewritten as “Saline solution (0.9 g/l) was…” Bend the rules if necessary to prevent confusion. For example, “The class has 6 18-year-old students” might be misinterpreted to mean “The class has 618-year-old students.” Write “6 eighteen-year-old students” or “six 18-year-old students” instead. 2.4.10 Rounding of numbers Too many decimals will be tiresome and may give a false impression of precision (eg “mean age was 47.8 years”). Too few may lead to loss of needed precision. You should have a systematic approach to rounding of numbers in the manuscript. This is harder than it may seem. Sometimes, rules for rounding are used, for example rounding to a certain number of decimal places or significant digits, but this does not always work [2]. Decimal places: The number of decimal places is the number of digits after the decimal. Eg 19.452 has three decimal places. Significant digits: Starting from the left, the first non-zero number is the first significant digit. Eg, for 45.31 the first significant digit is 4 and the second is 5 etc. In the number 0.0037152, the first significant digit is 3. From this follows that that a significant digit is unrelated to the decimal place. In general, using two significant digits is often appropriate. Some possible exceptions are listed below [2]: Round to two significant digits unless any of the below applies. Percentages: Use one one decimal place for values &lt;10%. Values &gt;90% may need one decimal place for comparisons. Two or more decimal places should be used only if some values are less than 0.1%. Thus, two significant digits will often work for percentages. Mean difference and regression coefficients: Use a number of decimal places so that the SE has two significant digits. Risk ratio: “Rule of four”. Round to three significant digits if the leading non-zero digit is less than four. Otherwise round to two significant digits. Confidence interval: Use the rule as for the corresponding effect size. P-values: Round up to one significant digit, and to &lt;0.001 if smaller than 0.001. Note that in the US, a point is used for decimal, not a comma. 2.5 Tables All tables and figures should be referenced from the text (Table 2.3). The table should be able to stand alone, so that one does not have to refer to the text when viewing it. Tabell 2.3: Baseline characteristics Variable Mean SD Age, years 55 8.3 Weight, kg 67 3.4 When preparing tables, use a clean table layout without colors or shading. Most journals recommend that tables only contain only horizontal lines as borders. It is usually clearer to separate categorical variables (eg percentages, frequencies) from numerical ones into separate tables, but since there is a limit on the number of tables in the paper one usually has to either combine them in the same table or (if there are not too many variables of a certain kind) to report some of it in the text instead of a table. Table title: Goes above the table. Include information on the test system (eg type of patients), and type of treatment (eg the drug name), and what was measured (egblood pressure). For example: “Table 2. Blood pressure before and after amlodipine treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease.” It is common to include a “Table 1” with descriptive statistics on the study group(s). Some tips for tables: If repeating the same data in two tables, combine them into one. If a table has large amounts of information, divide into categories. 2.6 Figures Consider what kind of plot to use based on the type of variables that are displayed. If both the dependent and independent variables are numeric, use line- or scatterplots. If only the dependent variable is numeric, use bar plots. Pie charts are visually misleading, so consider using a bar plot instead. Some tips for figures: Check so that the figure is clearly visible (sharp, using standard fonts, and not cluttered) when viewing the file you include in the manuscript. Use the figure legend to highligt the key message or to explain abbreviations or symbols. Do not use legends to include details, these can be elaborated in the methods section. Check so that all axes and curves are labelled and units of measurement specified. Figure legend: Goes below the figure. For content, see “Table title” above. Figure file format: Figures are usually included as small files (eg .png files) when submitting the manuscript, but for the final version larger file formats are required (usually .tif). 2.7 Scientific notation 2.7.1 Large and small numbers To write concisely, very large or very small numbers are written using scientific notation. Numbers are then written in powers of ten, eg two million = 2x10^6. 2.7.2 Mantissa: Scale verus precision Take the following example: The number Talet 125 000 can be written in scientific notation as 1.25x10^3, where the part 1.25 (the “mantissa” or “significant”) represents the precision of the number, while 10³ (the “power term”) represents the scale of the number. If we for example are interested in describing the distance between the Sun and the Earth (149 600 000 kilometers), it is usually not meaningful (or even possible since the distance varies) to specify the number with a large precision. We can then for example elect to specify the distance with the precision 150 and scale x10⁶, ie 150x10⁶ kilometers. 2.8 References in the manuscript Journals will have different styles for citation (the reference in the text) and bibliography (the reference list at the end of the manuscript). You therefore need to use a reference management software, such as EndNote or Zotero, so that you can easily swith between styles. However the link between citation and bibliography can easily be broken when the manuscript is sent around for review by the other authors. Therefore, when drafting the manuscript, one way is to use author name and year in parentheses instead of numbers, so that the references dont get mixed up. 2.9 Resources 2.9.1 Style guides 🔗 APA style gives guidance on how details in scientific papers can be presented, for example the formatting of tables.

Statistics are used to describe and summarise the data (descriptive statistics) and to calculate measures of association between variables. Some basic statistical terms that you should be familiar with are listed below. Normal distribution. Whether the data is normally distributed decides what statistics are appropriate to describe it and to test associations. Mean (a “point estimate”) and standard deviation (a “variance estimate”). these are appropriate for data with normal distribution. Median (point) and Quartiles (variance). These are appropriate for non-normally distributed data.

Below, some types of bias are listed, with focus on pharmacoepidemiological studies. Bias should be considered in the planning stage of the study, and addressed in the study protocol. There are different ways to categorize bias, but main categories are [3]: Selection bias: Subjects do not rrepresent the source population. Misclassification bias: Incorrect information about exposure, covariables, or outcome. Confounding: Imbalance between groups regarding factors that affect the outcome. See “Confounding in observational studies based on large health care databases: problems and potential solutions” [4]. 5.1 Information bias “Misclassification bias arises by incorrect information about either exposure or outcome or covariates for the study participants.” [3] It can be useful to cite papers that validate the classifications you are using (eg if you use diagnostic codes from the Swedish national patient register see [5–9]). Sensitivity analyses using different methods for classification of exposure, outcome, and covariables can be considered. 5.1.1 Time-related bias “Most often a form of differential misclassification bias and should be recognised as they can be generally avoided by appropriate accounting of follow-up time and exposure status” [3] 5.1.1.1 Immortal time bias “Immortal time bias in pharmacoepidemiology refers to a period of cohort follow-up time during which death (or an outcome that determines end of follow-up) cannot occur.” [3] This is often found in studies that use comparisons against ‘non-users’. See “Immortal Time Bias in Pharmacoepidemiology” [10] for examples. 5.1.1.2 Immeasurable time bias 5.1.2 Time varying confounding See Handling time varying confounding in observational research [11] 5.1.3 Surveillance bias “Arises when patients in one exposure group have a higher probability of having the study outcome detected, due to increased surveillance, screening or testing of the outcome itself, or an associated symptom.” [3] “This non-random type of misclassification bias can be reduced by selecting an unexposed comparator group with a similar likelihood of screening or testing, selecting outcomes that are likely to be diagnosed equally in both exposure groups, or by adjusting for the surveillance rate in the analysis.” [3] Consider handling of missing data, for example using multiple imputation. Adjust for confounders. Use an active comparator group (in pharmacoepidemiology). 5.2 Selection bias “Selection bias entails the selective recruitment into the study of subjects that are not representative of the exposure or outcome pattern in the source population.” [3] 5.2.1 Healthy user effect “The healthy user effect is best described as the propensity for patients who receive one preventive therapy to also seek other preventive services or partake in other healthy behaviors.” [12] Using an active comparator (in pharmacoepidemiology) reduces selection bias. 5.2.2 The healthy adherer effect “The healthy adherer effect arises when patients who adhere to preventive therapy are more likely to engage in other healthy behaviors than their non-adherent counterparts.” [12] 5.2.3 Depletion of susceptibles “Unwanted exclusion from a safety assessment of persons discontinuing treatments following early adverse reactions” [3] New user design avoids this. 5.3 Confounding “Confounding is a bias in estimating an epidemiologic measure of effect resulting from an imbalance of other determinants of disease (or their proxies) in the compared groups.” [3] Consider carefully what confounders you should adjust for, and which ones you dont have information on (this can be noted as a limitation in the discussion section of the manuscript). 5.3.1 Confounding by indication “Confounding by indication refers to a determinant of the outcome parameter that is present in people at perceived high risk or poor prognosis and is an indication for intervention.” [3] Example CCB [13] 5.3.2 Protopathic bias “Protopathic bias arises when the initiation of a drug (exposure) occurs in response to a symptom of the (at this point undiagnosed) disease under study (outcome). […] It may be handled by including a time-lag, i.e. by disregarding all exposure during a specified period of time before the index date.” [3] 5.3.3 Unmeasured confounding and ways to measure confounding Consider ways to measure confounding. Consider sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounding [13,14].

I filmen “Powers of Ten” zoomas perspektivet från det mikroskopiska till det kosmiska, med skalan noterad i tiopotenser som referens: POWERS OF TEN © 1977 EAMES OFFICE LLC (Available at www.eamesoffice.com) Nedan följer en film som jämför storleken på olika planeter och stjärnor: 6.3.3 Sambandet mellan hjärtfrekvens och livslängd I boken “Scale” tas korrelationen mellan hjärtfrekvens och livslängd upp, vilket kan illustreras med följande figur: Figur: Hjärtfrekvens och livstid hos däggdjur. X-axeln är i Log2-skala, vilket innebär att en enhets skillnad motsvarar en fördubbling av hjärtfrekvensen. En människa har hjärtfrekvens 60 slag/minut och en hamster 450 slag/minut. Vi ser att människan har en något längre livslängd än vad som skulle förutsägas av vår medelhjärtfrekvens. Data för figuren kommer från Thayer Watkins vid San José State University, som också skriver: A useful line of analysis is to consider the effect of scale changes for creatures which are similar in shape and only differ in scale. As the scale of an animal increases the body weight and volume increase with the cube of scale. The volume of blood flow required to feed that bulk also increases with the cube of scale. The cross sectional area of the arteries and the veins required to carry that blood flow only increases with the square of scale. There are other area-volume relationships which impose limitations on creatures. 6.3.4 Notering Genom evolutionen varierar en arts storlek beroende på temperatur och andra omgivningsfaktorer. 6.3.5 Evolutionens hastighet Se artikeln om tid 6.3.6 Snabb anpassning Snabb evolution vid högt selektionstryck.
